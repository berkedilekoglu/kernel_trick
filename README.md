# kernel_trick
Creating a single layer feed forward neural network according to Rahimi's randomized kernel transformation

-> Network was implemented from scratch
-> The first layer of our network will make randomized kernel transformation
-> The second layer will make linear classification
-> Softmax cross entropy loss will be used
