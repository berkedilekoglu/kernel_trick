# kernel_trick
Creating a single layer feed forward neural network by using Rahimi's randomized kernel transformation.


ML_banana_dataset will be used!

* Network was implemented from scratch

* The first layer of our network will make randomized kernel transformation

* The second layer will make linear classification

* Softmax cross entropy loss will be used
